# Flask Api
This project automates updating financial values based on an index using the "CÃ¡lculo Exato" website. The Java solution sends a request with the necessary parameters and displays the result or a timeout message. 
The Python solution interacts with the portal, fills in the data, performs calculations, and returns the results. The goal is to improve efficiency and accuracy in the financial update process.
